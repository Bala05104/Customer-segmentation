What is RFM Analysis?
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.

RFM factors illustrate these facts:

the more recent the purchase, the more responsive the customer is to promotions
the more frequently the customer buys, the more engaged and satisfied they are
monetary value differentiates heavy spenders from low-value purchasers
